                  What are weddings, baptisms, networking gatherings, funerals,
                  job interviews, picnics, holiday parties, baby and bridal
                  showers all about? It's always difficult to decide what to
                  wear to them. What you dress to any of these events is
                  determined by a variety of circumstances, including the
                  location, the formality of the invitation, the weather, and,
                  in many cases, what everyone else is planning to wear.
                  However, there are certain broad sartorial norms to which you
                  might refer for help. (Remember, most dress code "laws" are
                  more like guidelinesâ€”with a few exceptions, such as not
                  wearing white to a wedding.)

                  Wear a charming daytime dress, perhaps in a petal or floral

                  Bring a light sweater, blazer, or smart jacket to cover up
                  sleeveless designs and avoid anything low cut, short, or
                  clinging. Wear a cocktail dress or stylish slacks with a
                  jacket or wrap to cover up in the temple or church if there is
                  a reception immediately following the ceremony and no time to
                  change.

                Consider tuxedos, glimmering materials, and extravagant accents.
                While etiquette laws on dress length are relaxing, a tea-length
                or floor-length gown is your best choice. A column or A-line
                dress is most refined, but a well-tailored, sleek, and formal
                suit is also appropriate. It's time to dress up your look with
                beautiful jewelry, wonderful shoes, and a stunning hairdo.

                If the invitation reads "black tie optional," you may relax a

                cocktail dress is suitable.

                <p class="lead text-light">
                  The party dress code for one of these rather formal gatherings
                  will most likely be "cocktail attire" (although not as fancy
                  as a black-tie reception). So go for a cocktail dressâ€”you
                  can't go wrong with a little black dress or a jewel-toned or
                  pastel piece. Dress it up with fancy items as well.
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-light">
                  Cocktail parties nowadays may range from a fancy social affair
                  (cue that sparkly knee-length number from the "special
                  occasions" section) to a low-key gathering of pals gathered
                  around a plate of snacks. However, "cocktail parties are
                  dressy-casual, so you can't go wrong with a blouse with some
                  particular embellishments and a skirt or fitted slacks, with
                  heels or elegant flats," according to fashion expert Joseph
                  Williamson. "Avoid materials that are too casual, such as
                  chino, jersey, and denim," and avoid super-short fashions. To
                  see if a hemline is acceptable, stand with your hands at your
                  sides and check the hemline: it should not be higher than your
                  fingers.
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-light">
                  Another thing to keep in mind is that various cities have
                  varying clothing codes. There's no need to overthink it, but
                  it's worth remembering. "Regardless of the weather changes,
                  cocktail clothing in Miami is just as formal and stylish as in
                  New York, but in San Diego, it's interpreted a bit more
                  casually since the city is easygoing," says Lauren A. Rothman,
                  creator of Style Auteur, a fashion-consulting organization
                  located in Washington, D.C.

                A pantsuit or knee-length dress with a cardigan or jacket on top
                is a safe bet for what to wear to a funeral. Jewelry should be
                delicate and unobtrusive (simple studs and a minimalist pendant
                necklace). This is not the time to be showy or fashionable;
                instead, keep things orderly, courteous, and modest (unless
                otherwise instructed).
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                In terms of color, black is a popular option, but it is not
                required. What matters most is conveying the solemnity of the
                occasion, which may be done with toned-down apparel in "dark
                neutrals, such as navy, brown, and forest green," according to
                etiquette expert Leah Ingram. Patterns that are dark and
                discreet are also appropriate.

                  with a bold necklace or earrings. Then, wear it with a bright
                  dress, a sleek jumpsuit, or a festive top with a quirky midi
                  skirt or palazzo pants. If you wear tactile accessories like
                  feathers, tassels, lace, sequins, beading, or bows, you'll get

                Shower attire includes a flattering, feminine dress, a patterned
                skirt and sweater, or a colorful pair of leggings and a flowing
                top. Wear flats or heels (whatever you choose), or lovely
                booties if it's cold outside. Remember that bridal showers
                follow the same conventions as weddings: unless the bride or the
                shower hosts express otherwise, white should be saved for the
                bride. Black isn't out of the question, but make sure it's more
                elegant than melancholy.

                Pack for a warm-weather cruise what you would for a warm-weather
                beach trip during the day: shorts, breezy shirts, sundresses,
                skirts, bathing suits, coverups, sandals, and shoes. Pack a
                range of clothes you'd wear throughout the day on an autumn or
                winter vacation for a cold-weather cruise: jeans, leggings,
                slacks, sweaters, shoes, winter coat, boots, and flats (include
                a bathing suit or two if there's a hot tub or indoor pool). Be
                at ease and calm, but keep in mind that you are not alone at
                home.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Many cruise ships provide a variety of restaurant selections
                ranging in formality from very casual (no bathing suits without
                cover-ups, bare feet, or ripped jeans) to smart casual and
                formal. If there is only one main dining area, the dress code
                may vary during the voyage (for example, casual the first night,
                and formal or maybe even black-tie to celebrate the last night).
                Bring a couple different dinner outfits for each need.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                For a casual meal, you can't go wrong with a knee-length
                sundress or clean white trousers and a lovely blouse combined
                with sandals or flats. For a smart-casual night, replace the
                white denim with finer pants, attractive jewelry, and a pair of
                wedges or clunky shoes. Tea-length or floor-length dresses,
                heels, and a pretty wrap work perfectly for formal nights.
                Again, some cruises incorporate a black-tie dinner, in which
                case, go ahead and dress to the nines.

                  Maintain a professional, clean, and suitable appearance. Pumps

                  dress are always appropriate for a job interview. These are
                  the norm for most corporate jobs, but if you're looking for
                  work in a more laid-back profession, such as a tech startup,
                  design agency, or trendy magazine, feel free to exhibit your
                  particular flair. However, being overly fashionable or
                  informal might be unappealing. Avoid jangly, distracting
                  jewelry, as well as denim (yes, even if the prospective
                  company dress code is casual; you should always be more
                  dressed up than the people who work there)..

              <p class="lead">
                Don't overthink it when it comes to what to dress to a
                graduation ceremony. It's sleek and tidy, but not overly formal.
                If you're the graduate, don't wear anything you'll be
                embarrassed to wear in a slew of graduation photographs or
                during a celebration meal with your grandparents. A knee-length
                bright, white, or floral dress is an excellent choice for the
                joyful event. Also, to walk easily across the stage, wear
                comfortable heels, flats, wedges, or attractive sandals.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Follow the same recommendations as above for someone else's
                graduation, or as you would for a springtime baptism, bar
                mitzvah, or Easter celebration: tidy, enjoyable, and
                considerate, but not unduly extravagant. Try elegant cropped
                trousers with a good top, a pretty patterned skirt, or a bright
                sundress made of excellent fabric. Many graduations take place
                in late spring or early summer, and they sometimes entail
                sitting outside for lengthy grad ceremonies, so keep the weather
                in mind. To avoid being overheated in long sleeves or slacks,
                choose an airy A-line dress or skirt. If it's raining, you could
                be transferred to an air-conditioned theater or gymnasium, so
                bring a shawl or sweater to keep warm.

                <p class="lead text-light">
                  Here's one word to guide you: polished. When dressed for a
                  business function, the culture of your office should take
                  precedence. "If you work in a conservative setting, dress
                  conservatively for gatherings as well," Williamson advises.
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-light">
                  Wear something more formal than what you'd wear to work. Wear
                  a lovely jewelry or blouse with your suit, or go for a skirt
                  and heels instead of slacks and flats. You are the expert on
                  your company's dress code, so err on the conservative side,
                  especially if you will be interacting with clients or work
                  superiors. Dress comfortably for the events on the program for
                  a casual outing, such as a workplace picnic or a charity 3K
                  run. Simply avoid anything dubious or controversial
                  (super-revealing tank tops, barely-there ripped denim shorts,
                  or T-shirts with eyebrow-raising messaging or graphics).
